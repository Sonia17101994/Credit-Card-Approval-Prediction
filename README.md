# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction
# Overview:
The "Credit Card Approval Prediction" project aims to optimize the credit card application approval process for a forward-thinking bank's credit card department. In an era where data science plays a crucial role in financial institutions, the primary focus is to acquire new credit card customers while minimizing risks. The bank employs a data-driven credit assessment system known as Credit Scoring, which includes an application scorecard model. This scorecard assists in determining credit card approval by estimating the applicant's risk level based on strategic priorities. To make informed decisions, the bank leverages applicant data and external data sources.

# Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to minimize the bank's risk and maximize profitability by effectively assessing credit card applicants. The bank evaluates applicants based on their nature of work, income range, and family orientation to approve or reject credit card applications. This project uses an exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach to gain insights, discover relationships, and unravel data patterns. It aims to provide data-driven insights that align with the bank's objective of responsible lending.
